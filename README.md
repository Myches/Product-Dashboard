## üìù Design Decisions & Assumptions

- **API Handling**: Implemented comprehensive data fetching and mutation logic using React Query with established robust error handling and loading state for all API calls
- **Responsive Design**: Prioritized mobile responsiveness
- **Performance Optimizations**: Implemented pagination to limit the number of products loaded at once
- **Local Storage**: Used for favorites persistence as it provides a simple solution without requiring backend modifications

## üîÆ Future Improvements

With more time, I would add:
- **Unit Tests**: Expand the coverage of the tests
